# Chibi-world with Vite

My repo to learn some rust nice-ness and build my mini game using:
[Roguelike Tutorial - In Rust](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_0.html)
As my main guide, and filling in any broken links or gaps that I run into.

#### Cargo template
[My fork of @parrotmac's updated vite template](https://github.com/alexortiz201/rust-wasm-hello-world)


### NOTES:
 - pnpm is being used
 - inside of www run pnpm i to install deps
 - when wanting to test build, run `npx vite` from www folder
